# password-generator
A JavaScript password generator

## About
This password generator randomly creates a password between 8 and 128 characters in length, based on several user-chosen parameters.

When the "generate" button is pressed, the user is first prompted to choose a length or to cancel. As long as the choice is within the correct range, they will then be prompted with the types of characters to include in the password, of which at least one must be chosen or the prompt will begin again.

Once the parameters have all been chosen, the password is generated and displayed on the page.

The user also has the option to, with the press of a second button, copy the result to their clipboard.
